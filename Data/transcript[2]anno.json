So exact timing, we really don't want to give you that right now, but it's -- it looks to be coming.Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystGot it. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to hit the logic and foundry opportunity dynamic into 2020. Obviously, you guys have done a great job over the past couple of years and gaining share in both buckets. If we assume that spending in logic and foundry is largely flat in 2020, and if you assume EUV adoption continues to grow. Based on what you guys know from a design win or application win perspective, can you still grow logic and foundry revenues in that sort of environment backdrop? Thanks.Tim Archer -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYes, it's a great question and the answer is yes, we would expect to grow in that scenario, based on a couple of things; one, as you move forward, even on the same WFE, our SAM as a percent of that WFE should increase as transition still continued to occur to more advanced nodes. Etch and deposition opportunity increases at each successive technology node, even in the face of EUV. So I think in the scenario described, we would expect to have a larger opportunity and we do believe that we're winning share as well and therefore we would grow.Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystGreat. Thanks so much.Tim Archer -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Toshiya.OperatorThank you. We'll hear now from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- AnalystYes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them; first one for either Tim or Doug. More a industry focused question you spoke about how NAND bit growth exiting this year is going to be 30%, kind of, curious like ask your customers start ramping 128 layer NAND, if next year demand bit growth is below 30%. Do you still expect the 120 layers spending to go through next year, because it's more strategic, low cost in nature? Or do you think it might get throttle back if demand bit growth is slower?Doug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerMaybe I'll take and then Tim you can add-on. I mean, Krish what -- one I don't think that's what's going to happen. But we're that to be what happened, I think you would see a year that looked something like this year in that most of the industry spending was allocated to node conversions as opposed to new capacity adds, because that lowers cost per bit, the economics are better and all of that.The other thing I would say, and then I'll let Tim add-on. When we look into early next year, I believe supply growth rate will continue to decline based on the investment set have occurred this year, right? Because they have reduced this year and so you're moving into a declining rate of growth, as we look into the first half of next year. Tim, anything you want to add?Tim Archer -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYes, I think just to reiterate Doug's point, I mean, technology transitions we think occur every year, simply because of the benefit to bit cost. And so, I guess, I would say that in any year, which is not our view of declining supply growth we would still see the majority of the spend in technology transitions. And I guess there is one other key point to think about, we've mentioned this a few times in a technology transition from say 96 layers to 128 layers, the majority of that spend is for etch and deposition. So there's definitely an outperformance statement there, if spend continues to be based just on technology transitions.Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- AnalystGot it, got it. That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, I think, Tim in your prepared comments you spoke about how you guys are successfully defended 100% dielectric etch market share. I'm kind of curious on the NAND side, is that a fair enough statement, if you look past 128 layer higher than 128 layer DTOR tools or is it more up to 128 layers?Tim Archer -- President and Chief Executive OfficerWell, in our statement is always as those decisions are made. So we always speak about accomplishing made. So I don't know if any decisions have been made well beyond the 128 layer node. So we -- it's obviously something that we compete for it every node. But, I guess what I'd point out is there is a very important piece of learning that has come from us running now millions of wafers through our dielectric etch tools. And there was a question earlier about, productivity, reliability, stability, defect performance. Those are all things that again we have millions and millions of wafers of experience. And so kind of come in with an edge every node that you have to compete for as the incumbent. So that -- but specifically, I think, you could bucket most of those in that 128 nanometer and below node since their decisions already made.Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- AnalystGot it. Thanks, Tim. Thanks, Doug.Tim Archer -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Krish.OperatorThank you. We'll hear from Patrick Ho with Stifel.Patrick Ho -- Stifel -- AnalystThank you very much. And also congrats on a really nice quarter. Maybe, Tim, first, a lot of the market questions have been answered on my end. But as you look at next generation memory technologies like MRAM, ReRAM. Can you just give a -- maybe a qualitative view of how Lam is positioning itself to capitalize on those next generation opportunities?Tim Archer -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYes, I guess maybe the simpler statement that I make inside the company is we're not running from our leadership position in memory, and that includes in these new emerging memory markets. And so we're actively looking to develop new applications, new tools that meet the needs of those devices. We've spoken about, one of them in particular so far this year, which is the ion beam edge tool, that's used for MRAM and we have established a very strong position for that particular application, phase-change memory ReRAM, there are other devices we are actively engaged in development with the leading companies. So it is a target market for us, in fact, one might argue that we feel we, sort of, we already sort of own that memory space and I think it's our focus.Doug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIt's Dough [Phonetic] just to add-on, if you really want more detail you can go look at the transcript of the Flash Memory Summit, where Tim and Rick Gottscho spent lots of time talking about how we view these emerging memory architectures.Patrick Ho -- Stifel -- AnalystGreat. Thanks, Doug. And maybe as my follow-up question, you talked a little bit about your atomic layer deposition opportunity. I guess from a big picture perspective, how do you see the total available market for you in that? And do you see it expanding from where -- it looks like you have a strong position on the memory side of thing. Can this also expand onto the foundry/logic side of things?Tim Archer -- President and Chief Executive OfficerSo we'd already has expanded, I mean, ALD is not memory specific. So we use these films also on the logic and foundry side. ALD atomic layer etching and atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching, these are technologies that will continue to be increasingly used as devices become smaller and smaller and structures become more complex. So I think it's an expanding market opportunity, and in fact I think in coming years, you'll start to see inflections for instance from batch processing tools to single wafer ALD just again for the type of wafer uniformity and requirements of those processes going forward. So it's an area where we're growing and we feel confident about our development activities in the tools themselves.Patrick Ho -- Stifel -- AnalystGreat. Thank you.Tim Archer -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Patrick.OperatorThank you. We'll hear now from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.Craig Ellis -- B. Riley FBR -- AnalystYes. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I wanted to follow-up on the comments that you made that calendar '20 to be a year of outperformance for Lam. Can you just help us understand how much of that comes from moving deeper into the sweet spot of the foundry/logic share gain that you've been talking about versus help that you would get from what appears to be a nice and very encouraging upturn that's starting to occur in NAND or maybe something else like SAM expansion?Tim Archer -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYes, I think for us to give you more detail on the break out on that you'll have to wait until we actually speak to our 2020 WFE outlook next quarter. But you kind of hit it, I mean, we -- the way I think about outperformance in 2020, it's just what you said. First and foremost you -- everyone knows that we are highly leveraged to the memory market, and we do believe that spending mix moves back in our favor next year. And even in the face of stronger and continuing strength in logic and foundry memory will improve to some extent. We've strengthened our logic and foundry SAM opportunity, as well as share position and so that's a continued benefit as logic and foundry remain strong. And also as Doug mentioned CSBG continues to grow as we expand our portfolio of advanced services in that space. And so can break it out for you, how much each of those contributes, but each of them is important part of the story in 2020.Craig Ellis -- B. Riley FBR -- AnalystThanks, Tim. And then I'll do the follow-up to Doug. Doug impressive trough-to-trough operating margin improvement of about 300 basis points. And within that there is dramatic improvement with operating expense as a percentage of sales. And as you noted, there's been significant mix shift R&D. The question is how much further benefit is there in the model for increased operating leverage? And how much room do you have to further drive expense toward R&D from SG&A?Doug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIt's something we've been working on for years, I mean, Tim was driving those on years ago, honestly in rest of companies rally behind it. We're going to keep squeeze in efficiency out every SG&A dollar we spend. We want to be totally rigorous about that. So that we can allocate more of those dollars to R&D, I think that 60%, 70% last quarter might be an all-time high for the company. I haven't gone all the way back, but in my recent memory that was an all-time high. We're going to keep at that, we're going to continue to try to get better, we do this every words part of the culture of the company to be focused on continuous improvement. I don't know how we can get it obviously, but we're going to keep working on it.Craig Ellis -- B. Riley FBR -- AnalystThanks guys.Doug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks, Craig.OperatorThank you. We'll hear now from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystThanks for taking my question. And I joined a little late, so I apologize if this was asked. But DRAM was quite strong in the quarter. And I'm wondering what caused that and how sustainable is that trend?Tim Archer -- President and Chief Executive OfficerWhen I look at it, it's primarily conversion spending. That's really what we've seen for the entire year is focused on node conversions, it will ebb and flow. The important thing when you think about DRAM is to understand when we look at similar to what we were describing NAND exiting the year below where we believe demand growth to be, you got a similar story in DRAM. As we look at the investments that are occurring in DRAM this year exiting the year supply growth is probably in the low teens. And we believe long-term demand growth is in high teens maybe approaching 20%. There is a ways to go, Vivek to continue to burn inventory out of the channel. I think that's going to take a little bit longer. But what I do know is at some point the inventory will be burned off and spending will grow more significantly. In quarter-by-quarter, it's just going to be dependent on what projects are under way at what customers.Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystGot it. Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, kind of, looking at your cash flow generation. So fiscal '19 from what I noticed there was a lot of cash inflow from working capital that I'm looking at the model right. How should we think about the plus and minus from working capital this year? Thank you.Doug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIf you look at the first half of this year, Vivek -- calendar year again. I never really think too much in terms of fiscal calendar year. I mean we're -- cash was just super strong, I think we had two consecutive quarters around $900 million in operational cash flow and you're right. A lot of that came from working capital. Now what you normally see with the business when it's growing, it will consume working capital, meaning it will take cash to build inventory and receivables and so forth. When it levels off or contracts, it will generate cash and that's really what went on in the first half of the year. I mean, we managed cash quite proactively, but the practical reality of business ebb and flow was that's what happens. The right way to think about the free cash flow of the business is it's a couple of points below where operational cash flow should be on a sustainable basis. But it will ebb and flow around wherever read in the business cycle.Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystThank you.Doug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes. You're welcome. Thanks for the question.OperatorThank you. We'll take our next question from Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo.Joe Lachky -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystYes, thanks for taking the question. You talked about improvements and inventory that you've seen across the NAND flash. I was wondering, if you could talk about 2018 [Phonetic] factory utilization rates and your installed base?Tim Archer -- President and Chief Executive OfficerIt's hard for us actually to put our finger on exactly what utilizations are. I mean we saw it pulled back a little bit in both NAND and DRAM this year. And I think that was pretty well-telegraphed from our customers. But better -- it's a better question to put to them, we don't always know exactly what their utilizations are running at.Joe Lachky -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystOkay, fair enough. And then maybe a follow-up to that. You talked about exiting this year at 30% supply growth, I mean, for NAND and maybe and potentially going lower than that next year on the first part of the year. I guess, the question is how do we think about the level of capacity expansion needed to hit kind of the -- I guess, expected demand growth for 2020?Doug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerTough question to answer Joe, to be honest. What's occurred this year and NAND largely has been conversions, maybe with a couple exceptions. But if you look at NAND, WFE through the year -- this year, but that's what was going on. And you saw declining rate of supply growth such that as we exit the year obviously, we said 30% and I think long-term NAND growth is in the high '30s, maybe 40%. To have 40% supply growth, we need to be adding a few wafers every single year, and so it didn't happen quite so much this year and you've seen supply growth decline",{"entities":[[253,256,"B-PERCENTAGE"],[268,274,"INCREMENT"],[460,466,"INCREMENT"],[1068,1076,"B-REVENUE"],[2122,2128,"INCREMENT"],[2162,2165,"B-PERCENTAGE"],[2278,2281,"B-PERCENTAGE"],[10019,10028,"B-OPERATING"],[10036,10047,"INCREMENT"],[10126,10135,"B-OPERATING"],[10794,10797,"B-PERCENTAGE"],[10799,10802,"B-PERCENTAGE"],[12285,12288,"B-PERCENTAGE"],[13292,13296,"B-MONEY"],[13297,13304,"I-MONEY"],[15066,15069,"B-PERCENTAGE"],[15077,15083,"INCREMENT"],[15324,15330,"INCREMENT"],[15653,15662,"DECREMENT "],[15734,15737,"B-PERCENTAGE"],[15799,15802,"B-PERCENTAGE"],[15812,15815,"B-PERCENTAGE"]]}]]}
