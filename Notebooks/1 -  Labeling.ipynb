websitewith that let me hand the call over to timtim archer  president and chief executive officerthanks tina and welcome everyone in the september quarter lam delivered solid results our continued execution to commitments combined with our guidance for the december quarter increases our conviction that lam is in a strong position to outperform as wafer fabrication equipment spending inflects higher doug will cover the financial results in more detail shortly but i am especially pleased with the demonstrated earnings power of the companyat the midpoint of our december guide calendar year  diluted earnings per share will be the second highest in our history despite the current industry cycle i would like to take this opportunity to thank our customers and partners for their continued support of lam and our employees throughout the world for their contributions to these resultsfrom an industry perspective we have revised upward our view on  wfe to the mid billion range versus our prior estimate of down mid to high teens percentage yearonyear which implied a low  billion level of spending we are beginning to see improvement in the memory market led first by nand nand demand dynamics are improving and oversupply conditions should continue to abate as we move through the december quarter we expect to exit  with a bit supply growth rate for nand of approximately  which is well below our view on longterm demand and as a result nand inventories are expected to decline to normalized levels in the first half of calendar while the timing of a memory equipment spending recovery is always hard to predict we are encouraged that customers continue to manage supply growth even as we are starting to see favorable end market demand indicators this is a sign of a healthy industry and a good set up for increased nand spending in on the dram front inventories have remained elevated and we do not expect them to reach normalized levels until the second half of  however we see positive demand catalysts ahead in both the server and smartphone markets a server cpu upgrade cycle is expected to begin next year with increased adoption of new generation platforms from leading manufacturers for smartphones major vendors are planning to launch additional g models which is expected to drive content growth for the overall smartphone market in turning to foundry and logic spending in this segment has been strong throughout  and based on recent customer commentary looks to remain so heading into next year diverse end market applications are driving higher levels of foundry and logic spending moreover challenges in scaling functional blocks such as sram in logic devices are leading to increases in die sizes and these in turn are accelerating changes in device architectures and chip manufacturing technologieslams growing position with key foundry and logic customers has positioned us to incrementally benefit from these secular trends competitively we are executing at a high level based on the midpoint of our december guidance lams  foundry and logic revenues are set to significantly outgrow announced customer capex plans the share gains we are now seeing in the foundry and logic segment are the result of close customer collaboration and strong product execution over many years and multiple technology transitions they are evidence of the benefit of sustained investment in rd throughout industry cycleslooking at the market as a whole including memory foundry and logic we are on track in  to deliver our best ever penetration and defense performance as measured by net forwardlooking threeyear revenue opportunity for application decisions made in this calendar year a key contributor to our strong penetration and defense performance has been continued focus on technologies that enable d device architectures which are becoming increasingly important to performance and cost scaling across all market segments we invested early in d to d inflections and as these transitions are occurring we are seeing expansion in both our sam and market shareetch and deposition processes are critical enablers for d scaling and we are investing aggressively to deliver the technology and productivity innovation required to satisfy customer roadmaps as evidenced by our penetration and defense wins this year we believe we are extending lams leadership in this spacein d nand we have successfully defended  of our memory whole dielectric etch positions and continue to be the supplier for this application at all d nand manufacturers we are also winning d nand applications where productivity is the primary point of differentiation notably lam has been the first to deliver productionproven edge yield solutions for etch in this quarter we used our corvus tunable edge hardware on our flex dielectric etch system to improve profile tilt uniformity and win an important productivity sensitive slit etch applicationon the conductor etch front we want to d nand application for a new vertical architecture that reduces die size and is a technical solution for lowering bit cost in deposition we recorded an important d nand win for the vector dt which deposits backside films to control stress as layer counts increase another significant deposition win was for our striker ald tool used to deposit high quality liners and gap fill as aspect ratios get higherwe also continued to extend our d expertise and position outside of the d nand space including in rapidly growing markets such as advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration over the last three years the installed base for our sabre d electroplating system has grown by more than  and we are the leading electroplating supplier for tsv for dram cmos image sensor and logic devices our sabre d electroplating solutions embed bestinclass technology backed by years of highvolume production experiencewith each successive win across our served markets the installed base of lam equipment continues to grow resulting in an expanding longterm revenue opportunity for our customer support business to create value for customers over the entire life cycle of tool ownership we are actively developing upgrades and advanced services targeted extending technical capability and increasing productivity from existing installed base assets these offerings help our customers reduce their total cost and as a result we continue to see growing demandrevenues from our customer support business grew in the september quarter on a sequential basis and our reliant business achieved record quarterly revenue for the third quarter in a row we expect  overall will be another growth year for our customer support businesslooking at our yeartodate performance we have made tremendous progress against our objectives of expanding our sam increasing our market share and building our installed base business importantly  has been a year where lam has strengthened its position in the foundry and logic segment also with early indications of improving nand demand and positive catalysts on the horizon for dram we are increasingly optimistic that calendar year  is setting up to be a year of outperformance for lam as spending mix boost back in our favorthanks again for joining today and now heres dougdoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officerokay great thank you tim and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today and what i know is a busy earnings season were pleased with lams performance in the september quarter our results once again exceeded the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics operating income and diluted earnings per share came in at the highend of our guidance range as we remained prudent in managing our spending throughout the quarterlet me begin as i always do by talking about our revenue segmentation in the september quarter the combined memory segment was flat with the june quarter at  of total systems revenue we had a decrease in the september quarter in the nonvolatile memory segment moving from  to  while dram increased to  from  of systems revenue spending in the nand segment was focused on multiple nodes and were beginning to see the first ramp of  layer structureson the dram side apart from the x and y nodes we are seeing initial investments at z as i noted in our last quarter earnings call foundry and logic spending was strong and we expect strength from this segment to continue through the remainder of the calendar year the foundry segment represented  of our systems revenue in the quarter strength in this segment is related to spending on the  and nanometer nodeswhile logic and other segment was down slightly from the prior quarter level coming in at  of system revenue weve continued to demonstrate strong progress in the foundry and logic segments enabling us to maintain solid profitability levels during a period of depressed memory spending i believe foundry and logic spending will be even stronger in decemberrevenues for the quarter came in at  million which was again above the midpoint of guidance while revenue had a slightly broader geographic mix in the september quarter compared to the june quarter our top regions continue to be china korea and taiwan the china region quarter performance remains higher than our historic average concentration of revenue and similar to what i talked about last quarter the majority of this came from indigenous chinese customers across multiple segmentsgross margin came in at  which was  basis points above the midpoint mainly due to customer mix and as weve stated in prior quarters you should expect gross margins to be a function of several factors such as business volumes product mix and customer concentration and we expect to see variability quartertoquarter we continue to manage our spending levels in the company as operating expenses in the september quarter declined to  million which was down from  million in the previous quarter we remain laser focused on investing in research and development programs as we saw the percentage of spending in rd increased quarteroverquarter to  of operating expensesin the december quarter the guidance reflects total spending increasing back to the june level primarily doing  due to an increase in variable compensation expense our variable compensation fluctuates based on the level of quarterly profitability but also remind you that as we look ahead to the  calendar year you will see the normal seasonal spending increases related to the march quarter comes from things like payroll taxes operating income in the september quarter was  million and operating margin was  at the top of our guidance rangeour september quarter nongaap tax rate was approximately  which was slightly lower than our longterm rate there will be fluctuations in the rate from quartertoquarter and we now expect our longterm rate to be in the low teens levelother income and expense was a total of approximately  million in expense in the september quarter the main components of other income and expense our interest income from the cash and investment balances we hold offset by expense related to our outstanding debt the total interest expense and all tranches of our debt is right now about  million per quarter you should expect that other income and expense will fluctuate quartertoquarter based on several market related items such as our deferred compensation assets venture capital investments and foreign exchangewe continue to execute on our capital return program during the september quarter we allocated  million to capital return in the quarter with  million related to open market share repurchases and  million in dividends i would like to remind you that we continue to have an ongoing structured repurchase program that is expected to mature in the december quarter this will continue to reduce our share count we remain on track with our committed capital return we currently have approximately  billion remaining in our board authorized share repurchase programdiluted earnings per share came in at  which was at the high end of the guidance range that we provided for september we ended the september quarter with diluted shares for earnings per share at approximately  million shares which is the seventh consecutive quarter where our diluted share count has declined the share count includes a dilutive impact of approximately  million shares from the  convertible notes and ill remind you the dilution schedules for the remaining  convertible notes is available on our investor relations website for your referencelet me now switch to the balance sheet our cash and shortterm investments including restricted cash increased slightly in the september quarter to  billion from  billion in the june quarter cash flows from operations were  million which was offset by share repurchase and dividends yeartodate in calendar year  we have had strong cash from operations performance and were on track to end this year with the second highest level of free cash flows in the companys historydso increased to  days versus  in the prior quarter the dso increase is related to the timing of customer payments occurring at the end of the september calendar month which falls within our december fiscal quarter our inventory balance declined sequentially by  million which is the fifth consecutive quarter where inventory balance decline inventory turns were  turns which was just a little bit less than the  turns that we saw in the june quarternoncash expenses included approximately  million for equity compensation  million for depreciation and  million for amortization september quarter capital expenditures came in at  million which was a decrease from  million in the june quarter our september quarterend headcount was flat with the prior quarter at approximately  regular fulltime employeesso now looking ahead id like to provide our nongaap guidance for the december  quarter we are expecting revenue of  million plus or minus  million gross margin of  plus or minus  percentage point operating margins of  plus or minus  percentage pointand finally earnings per share of  plus or minus  based on a share count of approximately  million shares im pleased to share with you the results weve delivered throughout calendar year  and what has been a challenging industry environment as tim noted the supply demand environment is improving for the memory segments and weve made good progress in our foundry and logic positioning our installed base business continues to be on track to deliver a growth year in  were well positioned heading into  and are optimistic about our future performance going forwardfinally id like to announce our plans to host an investor day on march rd  in new york city details on the venue and precise time will be forthcomingoperator that concludes my prepared remarks tim and i would now like to open up the call for questionsquestions and answersoperatorthank you  and well take our first question from atif malik with citiatif malik  citi  analysthi thanks for taking my question and good job on the execution question on the wfe tim you mentioned wfe going from low  billion to mid  billion i want to spend if the majority of the increase has come from the foundrylogic segment in terms of the revised outlooktim archer  president and chief executive officermaybe a few modifications i mean clearly as weve said weve continued to see strengthening in foundry and logic so that is a portion of it the  some very early indications of nand spending increase as we now guided for december quarter and finally continuing strengthening in the china wfe as weve kind of seen increased strength throughout the year so combination of all those things lead to our upward revision in wfeatif malik  citi  analystokay and then just a followup in your prepared remarks you mentioned foundrylogic share gains above foundrylogic capex this year how should we think about the outperformance of your foundrylogic business into next year and out given that some of the elements like reuse and growing euv stepstim archer  president and chief executive officerwell thats a great question we basically  as we have said on a number of occasions the intensity of etch and deposition we see continuing increase at every technology node our sam grows whether itd be  to seven to five to three on into the future sam increases even in the face of euv increased usage and theres a number of reasons for that patterning complexity continues to increase regardless of the introduction of euv and so there are additional steps for deposition and etcheuv itself introduces new requirements for hardmasks which gives lam opportunity to participate from a deposition perspective and euv also we have talked about in the past introduces opportunities for new steps like end processes like atomic layer etching that can be used to help increase quality and productivity of the euv pattern itself so i think the way you should think about it is our sam is expanding competitively our  were gaining share at some of these new layers and we feel were well set up in both the foundry and logic space going forward as technology transitionsatif malik  citi  analystthankstim archer  president and chief executive officerthanks atifoperatorthank you well now take our next question from cj muse with evercorecj muse  evercore isi  analystyes good afternoon thank you for taking the question i guess first question if we look back to  it looks like your share of wallet in  for wfe with nand its roughly  so curious as you think about moving to a rising layer count and your leadership in high aspect ratio etch and the just announced deposition wins on the call tonight how should we think about your share of wallet as we go to  layer and above into tim archer  president and chief executive officerour sam as a percentage of customer spend continues to increase with layer count and thats for two reasons one i mean obviously the simple fact of building and etching the higher stack but also the fact that as i mentioned there are new steps and new opportunities that created for dealing with issues such as in the vector dt case distress associated with those taller layer counts so i think that our view is sam grows as layer count increasescj muse  evercore isi  analystthanks tim and i guess as a followup doug im not sure if you spoke to the entirety of installed base revenues but did they grow sequentially in september and how should we think about the trend or what should we kind of model it to  into doug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officeryes cj i think tim actually mentioned in his prepared remarks that they did grow sequentially and it was the third consecutive record quarter for the reliant component of that business im not going to quantify next year yet a little bit too soon but what we said in the past and i continue to be very comfortable saying today is i have a hard time envisioning a year when the installed base business doesnt grow it should grow every single year because chamber count grows every year its growing this year even in a depressed memory spending environment and we continue to bring new advanced service offerings to market that we hope enable us to achieve more and more of the customers opex spend so thats how you should be thinking about that cjcj muse  evercore isi  analystgreat thanks so muchdoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officerthanks cjoperatorthank you we will now take our next question from harlan sur with jpmorganharlan sur  jpmorgan  analystgood afternoon great job on the quarterly execution this is second quarter in a row of the heavier china domestic mix do you guys anticipate this bias to continue into the december quarter and into next year and similar to my question last time is this in your view a focused effort by china to accelerate their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities given the trade tensions with the us or more your china customers just having more confidence to move forward with their early memory and foundry programsdoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officeryes harlan what i tried to describe in fact im trying to fore shadow with last quarter in earnings that this is above normal run rate of local chinese customers spend but tim did point out in his remarks that some of the strengthening in wfe came from local china probably now and nominally somewhat above  billion in wfe and as we look into next year we absolutely think it will grow again next year but it will ebb and flow it will  these big projects can be lumpy at times and it will go up and it will go down depending on when equipment ships into any one fab projects tim you want to add anythingtim archer  president and chief executive officeryes i think that  as i commented weve seen strengthening in domestic china spend through the year anticipate that continuing and maybe the most important part of that story for lam is that clearly a big portion of the new incremental spending in china is targeted toward the memory market and obviously our sam and our share in the memory space is quite good so from that perspective we see china is area of strength for usdoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officeryes harlan i forgot the one part of your question you asked do we think anything pulled in actually really dont i dont think it would make sense that they would be pulling things in sooner and because if youre concerned about our inability to ship being the reason they pulled in then they can get spares and service from us they cant actually really utilize the tools very well so i dont believe that there was pullons really do anything like thatharlan sur  jpmorgan  analystgreat thank you thank you for the insights there and the team continues its strong design win momentum on noncritical andor legacy technology node as part of it as you pointed out is the reliant systems products continue to do well we continue to hear from your customers that theyre laser focused on productivity throughput uptime footprint all of the things that impact overall wafer costs are you guys now in a position to at least give us some sense on how fast the noncriticalrefurbished business systems  business is growing and roughly the size of this business relative to your total revenue basetim archer  president and chief executive officermaybe you have to wait till investor day for that no we do plan  we do  we have promised for some time now to provide you more detail in those areas and were just we will do that i think maybe a couple of points your comment about customers being laser focused on productivity i mean its one of the reasons why we have been talking about it it takes some time for those products for our efforts to really start to show up in new wins but you know were starting to see in this area that doug talked about in advanced services where some of these intelligent database tools are really starting to help us reduce for instance troubleshooting time on the systems reduced unscheduled downs on the systems and those are things that the customers are pulling hard for because again its productivity for tools that are already in place and relatively easy to implement so we are prioritizing productivity because its in the best interest of the customer and the industry as a wholeharlan sur  jpmorgan  analystyes thank youdoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officerthanks harlanoperatorthank you well hear now from john pitzer with credit suissejohn pitzer  credit suisse  analystyeah good afternoon guys thanks let me ask the question congratulations on the strong results tim i just want to go back to the market opportunity in logicfoundry for you if you kind of look at calendar yeartodate that business combined for you was up somewhere between  to  yearoveryear i guess im just trying to get a sense of how we think about your market position maybe in north america as we see  go to  go to seven and maybe in taiwan as we see seven go to five go to three can you talk a little bit about how much visibility you have on product tool of record on some of these critical etch and deposition steps and how we might think about your share opportunity as we migrate down these nodestim archer  president and chief executive officersure i can do that without quite getting as specific as north america taiwan on those notes so maybe ill point you just a couple of comments i made in  there was a little bit you know as i said it within the logic and foundry space it takes many years to establish yourself as the first  the development tool of record and then ultimately see that rollout into volume buys is the production tool of record and so when we talk about i gave  we gave a little bit of a new look into this penetration and defense forwardlooking threeyear revenue opportunity statement that is designed to give some indication as to how long it takes from the time we win one of those selection decisions and youll see that revenue opportunity will take place over those following three years thats definitely true in the foundry and logic spaceand so i think that when we talk about improving opportunity at  and then seven and then five you know you can kind of look out and say if youre like a nanometer decision is revenue opportunities that now were roll in over the course of the next several years so that may not be quite the level of specificity you wanted but it basically says things that we are winning now will actually be our revenue for the next three years plus in that spacejohn pitzer  credit suisse  analystthats helpful and then doug you mentioned in your prepared comments you still have about  billion left on the buyback and i apologize in capital allocation call but this most recent quarter the buybacks dipped down a little bit which i guess is understandable just given the level of uncertainty any color you can give us around the pace at which you might want to try to execute buybacks going forward and how we should think about kind of just remind us again the cash return policy youre trying to hitdoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officeryes john i mean one thing i would point out to you and if you look over the last two years you will have seen several quarters where the cash we actually deployed moved down somewhat that was because in the quarter before that we put one of these accelerated share repurchase programs in place you have the same phenomenon going on this quarter so even though the cash that we deployed in terms of open market repurchases wasnt all that significant this quarter that asr was still executing buying stock back and that asr thats currently out there will complete in the december quarter so well be thinking about what were going to do incrementally as we go forwardso far just remind you what we talked about and its been a while now the last analyst day that were committed to at least  of free cash flow returned to shareholders and obviously if you look at our history over the last five six years weve done a whole lot more than that and i had went on the timing to complete the current authorization and im going to kind of remain that way ive said in the past well be opportunistic and thats as much as i have quite right nowjohn pitzer  credit suisse  analystperfect thanks guys congratulationsdoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officerthank you johnoperatorthank you well take our next question from timothy arcuri with ubstimothy arcuri  ubs  analystthanks a lot i guess my first question doug is can you help us a little bit with the mix in december im curious if the uptick in revenue is going to be more on the nand side and more on the foundry side thanksdoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officeryes what i said tim in my remarks was i expect december will continue to be pretty strong with foundry and logic quarter so thats a key piece of whats going ontimothy arcuri  ubs  analystokay awesome and then i just wanted to  i just wanted to drill down a little bit into the china piece so china is about  of your revenues now on the trailing month basis so i guess im curious how much of this is going into indigenous projects versus the multinationals because i thought you said china was about  billion of  wfe and i think at that time you were talking about  billion of that  billion being domestic china and i think you just said that china is going to be over  this year so can you sort of like level set us on how much of that  this year will be multiversus domestic and maybe how much domestic can even grow next year thanksdoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officeryes let me walk it back for you a little tim because some things have moved around a little bit when i look at what happened last year local china ended up being i dont know  billion of wfe roughly so it ended up being maybe a little bit more than that for that we have been talking about and the way we see it today its above  its somewhat above  i dont know for sure what next year is going to look like but as we look at our analytics in the fab projects that are coming in and whatnot i do see pretty strongly believe it will grow next year im not ready to tell you how much yet well give you more clarity on our wfe view for next year on the next earnings call but i think local china will continue to grow next yeartimothy arcuri  ubs  analystand doug just to clarify those numbers are local china numbers rightdoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officerthats right tim yestimothy arcuri  ubs  analystokay awesome thanks so muchdoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officeryes youre welcomeoperatorthank you well take the next question from toshiya hari with goldman sachstoshiya hari  goldman sachs  analystyes thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong results tim you talked about early signs of a recovery in nand in your prepared remarks and doug you just mentioned that most of the growth or at least implicitly i think you commented that most of the growth in december quarter should be coming from foundry and logic so should we expect some of the nand projects that were all collectively hearing about should hit the march quarter from a rev rec perspectivetim archer  president and chief executive officeryes its maybe there is not such a big change here from what weve said we  you know ever since beginning of the year we said that memory spending would likely remain relatively weak throughout the year and when i talked about early signs it is the  its very early is in there were now starting to see some of those projects transpire as you just talked about meaning a little bit of ordering occurring in the december quarter but we still maintain our view that we exit the year with this  bit supply growth rate and that customers are prudently managing the supply growth but i do think those projects you know its kind of that early signs its a healthy industry and were going to see growth in  so exact timing we really dont want to give you that right now but its  it looks to be comingtoshiya hari  goldman sachs  analystgot it and then as a followup i just wanted to hit the logic and foundry opportunity dynamic into  obviously you guys have done a great job over the past couple of years and gaining share in both buckets if we assume that spending in logic and foundry is largely flat in  and if you assume euv adoption continues to grow based on what you guys know from a design win or application win perspective can you still grow logic and foundry revenues in that sort of environment backdrop thankstim archer  president and chief executive officeryes its a great question and the answer is yes we would expect to grow in that scenario based on a couple of things one as you move forward even on the same wfe our sam as a percent of that wfe should increase as transition still continued to occur to more advanced nodes etch and deposition opportunity increases at each successive technology node even in the face of euv so i think in the scenario described we would expect to have a larger opportunity and we do believe that were winning share as well and therefore we would growtoshiya hari  goldman sachs  analystgreat thanks so muchtim archer  president and chief executive officerthanks toshiyaoperatorthank you well hear now from krish sankar with cowen and companykrish sankar  cowen and company  analystyes hi thanks for taking my question i had two of them first one for either tim or doug more a industry focused question you spoke about how nand bit growth exiting this year is going to be  kind of curious like ask your customers start ramping  layer nand if next year demand bit growth is below  do you still expect the  layers spending to go through next year because its more strategic low cost in nature or do you think it might get throttle back if demand bit growth is slowerdoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officermaybe ill take and then tim you can addon i mean krish what  one i dont think thats whats going to happen but were that to be what happened i think you would see a year that looked something like this year in that most of the industry spending was allocated to node conversions as opposed to new capacity adds because that lowers cost per bit the economics are better and all of thatthe other thing i would say and then ill let tim addon when we look into early next year i believe supply growth rate will continue to decline based on the investment set have occurred this year right because they have reduced this year and so youre moving into a declining rate of growth as we look into the first half of next year tim anything you want to addtim archer  president and chief executive officeryes i think just to reiterate dougs point i mean technology transitions we think occur every year simply because of the benefit to bit cost and so i guess i would say that in any year which is not our view of declining supply growth we would still see the majority of the spend in technology transitions and i guess there is one other key point to think about weve mentioned this a few times in a technology transition from say  layers to  layers the majority of that spend is for etch and deposition so theres definitely an outperformance statement there if spend continues to be based just on technology transitionskrish sankar  cowen and company  analystgot it got it thats very helpful and then as a followup i think tim in your prepared comments you spoke about how you guys are successfully defended  dielectric etch market share im kind of curious on the nand side is that a fair enough statement if you look past  layer higher than  layer dtor tools or is it more up to  layerstim archer  president and chief executive officerwell in our statement is always as those decisions are made so we always speak about accomplishing made so i dont know if any decisions have been made well beyond the  layer node so we  its obviously something that we compete for it every node but i guess what id point out is there is a very important piece of learning that has come from us running now millions of wafers through our dielectric etch tools and there was a question earlier about productivity reliability stability defect performance those are all things that again we have millions and millions of wafers of experience and so kind of come in with an edge every node that you have to compete for as the incumbent so that  but specifically i think you could bucket most of those in that  nanometer and below node since their decisions already madekrish sankar  cowen and company  analystgot it thanks tim thanks dougtim archer  president and chief executive officerthanks krishoperatorthank you well hear from patrick ho with stifelpatrick ho  stifel  analystthank you very much and also congrats on a really nice quarter maybe tim first a lot of the market questions have been answered on my end but as you look at next generation memory technologies like mram reram can you just give a  maybe a qualitative view of how lam is positioning itself to capitalize on those next generation opportunitiestim archer  president and chief executive officeryes i guess maybe the simpler statement that i make inside the company is were not running from our leadership position in memory and that includes in these new emerging memory markets and so were actively looking to develop new applications new tools that meet the needs of those devices weve spoken about one of them in particular so far this year which is the ion beam edge tool thats used for mram and we have established a very strong position for that particular application phasechange memory reram there are other devices we are actively engaged in development with the leading companies so it is a target market for us in fact one might argue that we feel we sort of we already sort of own that memory space and i think its our focusdoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officerits dough  just to addon if you really want more detail you can go look at the transcript of the flash memory summit where tim and rick gottscho spent lots of time talking about how we view these emerging memory architecturespatrick ho  stifel  analystgreat thanks doug and maybe as my followup question you talked a little bit about your atomic layer deposition opportunity i guess from a big picture perspective how do you see the total available market for you in that and do you see it expanding from where  it looks like you have a strong position on the memory side of thing can this also expand onto the foundrylogic side of thingstim archer  president and chief executive officerso wed already has expanded i mean ald is not memory specific so we use these films also on the logic and foundry side ald atomic layer etching and atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching these are technologies that will continue to be increasingly used as devices become smaller and smaller and structures become more complex so i think its an expanding market opportunity and in fact i think in coming years youll start to see inflections for instance from batch processing tools to single wafer ald just again for the type of wafer uniformity and requirements of those processes going forward so its an area where were growing and we feel confident about our development activities in the tools themselvespatrick ho  stifel  analystgreat thank youtim archer  president and chief executive officerthanks patrickoperatorthank you well hear now from craig ellis with b riley fbrcraig ellis  b riley fbr  analystyes thanks for taking the question tim i wanted to followup on the comments that you made that calendar  to be a year of outperformance for lam can you just help us understand how much of that comes from moving deeper into the sweet spot of the foundrylogic share gain that youve been talking about versus help that you would get from what appears to be a nice and very encouraging upturn thats starting to occur in nand or maybe something else like sam expansiontim archer  president and chief executive officeryes i think for us to give you more detail on the break out on that youll have to wait until we actually speak to our  wfe outlook next quarter but you kind of hit it i mean we  the way i think about outperformance in  its just what you said first and foremost you  everyone knows that we are highly leveraged to the memory market and we do believe that spending mix moves back in our favor next year and even in the face of stronger and continuing strength in logic and foundry memory will improve to some extent weve strengthened our logic and foundry sam opportunity as well as share position and so thats a continued benefit as logic and foundry remain strong and also as doug mentioned csbg continues to grow as we expand our portfolio of advanced services in that space and so can break it out for you how much each of those contributes but each of them is important part of the story in craig ellis  b riley fbr  analystthanks tim and then ill do the followup to doug doug impressive troughtotrough operating margin improvement of about  basis points and within that there is dramatic improvement with operating expense as a percentage of sales and as you noted theres been significant mix shift rd the question is how much further benefit is there in the model for increased operating leverage and how much room do you have to further drive expense toward rd from sgadoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officerits something weve been working on for years i mean tim was driving those on years ago honestly in rest of companies rally behind it were going to keep squeeze in efficiency out every sga dollar we spend we want to be totally rigorous about that so that we can allocate more of those dollars to rd i think that   last quarter might be an alltime high for the company i havent gone all the way back but in my recent memory that was an alltime high were going to keep at that were going to continue to try to get better we do this every words part of the culture of the company to be focused on continuous improvement i dont know how we can get it obviously but were going to keep working on itcraig ellis  b riley fbr  analystthanks guysdoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officerthanks craigoperatorthank you well hear now from vivek arya with bank of americavivek arya  bank of america merrill lynch  analystthanks for taking my question and i joined a little late so i apologize if this was asked but dram was quite strong in the quarter and im wondering what caused that and how sustainable is that trendtim archer  president and chief executive officerwhen i look at it its primarily conversion spending thats really what weve seen for the entire year is focused on node conversions it will ebb and flow the important thing when you think about dram is to understand when we look at similar to what we were describing nand exiting the year below where we believe demand growth to be you got a similar story in dram as we look at the investments that are occurring in dram this year exiting the year supply growth is probably in the low teens and we believe longterm demand growth is in high teens maybe approaching  there is a ways to go vivek to continue to burn inventory out of the channel i think thats going to take a little bit longer but what i do know is at some point the inventory will be burned off and spending will grow more significantly in quarterbyquarter its just going to be dependent on what projects are under way at what customersvivek arya  bank of america merrill lynch  analystgot it very helpful and then as a followup kind of looking at your cash flow generation so fiscal  from what i noticed there was a lot of cash inflow from working capital that im looking at the model right how should we think about the plus and minus from working capital this year thank youdoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officerif you look at the first half of this year vivek  calendar year again i never really think too much in terms of fiscal calendar year i mean were  cash was just super strong i think we had two consecutive quarters around  million in operational cash flow and youre right a lot of that came from working capital now what you normally see with the business when its growing it will consume working capital meaning it will take cash to build inventory and receivables and so forth when it levels off or contracts it will generate cash and thats really what went on in the first half of the year i mean we managed cash quite proactively but the practical reality of business ebb and flow was thats what happens the right way to think about the free cash flow of the business is its a couple of points below where operational cash flow should be on a sustainable basis but it will ebb and flow around wherever read in the business cyclevivek arya  bank of america merrill lynch  analystthank youdoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officeryes youre welcome thanks for the questionoperatorthank you well take our next question from joe lachky with wells fargojoe lachky  wells fargo  analystyes thanks for taking the question you talked about improvements and inventory that youve seen across the nand flash i was wondering if you could talk about   factory utilization rates and your installed basetim archer  president and chief executive officerits hard for us actually to put our finger on exactly what utilizations are i mean we saw it pulled back a little bit in both nand and dram this year and i think that was pretty welltelegraphed from our customers but better  its a better question to put to them we dont always know exactly what their utilizations are running atjoe lachky  wells fargo  analystokay fair enough and then maybe a followup to that you talked about exiting this year at  supply growth i mean for nand and maybe and potentially going lower than that next year on the first part of the year i guess the question is how do we think about the level of capacity expansion needed to hit kind of the  i guess expected demand growth for doug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officertough question to answer joe to be honest whats occurred this year and nand largely has been conversions maybe with a couple exceptions but if you look at nand wfe through the year  this year but thats what was going on and you saw declining rate of supply growth such that as we exit the year obviously we said  and i think longterm nand growth is in the high s maybe  to have  supply growth we need to be adding a few wafers every single year and so it didnt happen quite so much this year and youve seen supply growth decline i dont know if that helps you but thats how i think about itjoe lachky  wells fargo  analystokay thanksoperatorthank you well take our next question from mitch steves with rbc capital marketsmitch steves  rbc capital markets  analysthey guys thanks for taking my question i really had two and most of them have been answered but from a high level i mean do you guys talking about kind of a better market for memory in  so when do you think well see capacity upgrades or is this all going to be technology upgradesand then secondly you guys gave a lot of color on nand but not so much in dram so based on the commentary about server demand and kind of an increase in q does that mean you guys think that  thats going to be kind of the bottom or do you think that exiting the year were going to start to see supply demand balance for dramtim archer  president and chief executive officerwell i think that what weve said about dram maybe just was that we think through the first half of next year inventory remains elevated and so its really not i guess our view at this point is dram maybe more of a second half story for next year obviously well give far more color as we develop our full  outlook its just that nand is much more upon us right now simply because the issues are being worked through more quickly as a result of the supply constraints that have been in place this year and maybe also the demand catalysts for nand that are occurring right nowmitch steves  rbc capital markets  analystgot it and is a capacity upgrades at what time in  is that like back half or do you think capacity upgrades will begin earlier than thatdoug bettinger  executive vice president and chief financial officermitch too soon for us to talk in any detail about  hold off for one quarter well give you a little better visibility on it its

uncertainties that can change as the world changes please see the cautionary statements in todays press release and in our various securities and exchange commission filingsfinally some of todays remarks will adjust for those items that affect comparability between periods these items are explained in our nongaap reconciliations included in our press release now ill turn the call over to ronronald j kramer\\xa0\\xa0chairman of the board and chief executive officerthanks and good afternoon everyone i hope you and all your families are doing well in these turbulent times griffon entered the unprecedented covid19 pandemic from a position of strength both operationally and competitively building on our already strong results in this fiscal year prior to march our businesses have benefited from the stayathome nature of the pandemic both existing and new customers have been investing in home projects such as closet renovations tending to their lawns and gardens and enhancing their enjoyment of the outdoors upgrading the exterior of their homes including their garage doors we believe these trends will continue to grow in the years aheadour third quarter results were outstanding revenues increased 10% adjusted ebitda increased 31% and adjusted earnings per share increased 90% compared to the prior year period these results are a reflection of the strategic actions taken by griffon starting with the september 2017 announcement regarding the disposition of our plastics business and the purchase of closetmaid further enhanced by the purchase of cornellcookson in june of 2018 coupled with the home improvement trends that i described our pivot out of the capitalintensive commoditydriven plastics business into branded domestically manufactured consumer and professional product businesses positioned us for market share gains as well as revenue earnings and cash flow growthfurther underscoring this quarters results our 2020 ninemonth free cash flow increased 34 million over the comparable 2019 ninemonth period and builds on the prior years full year free cash flow of 69 million as a result of this performance our net debt to ebitda leverage has been reduced by one full turn from the prior year quarter to 44 timesensuring the health and safety of our employees and our customers continues to be our top priority since early march we have proactively implemented health and safety measures across our global workforce as local and national authorities have circulated additional guidelines for employee health and safety weve incorporated those as well all of our facilities are operational and continue to maintain additional safety measures to protect our workers while maintaining operationsin consumer and professional products and home and building products all of our us canadian and australian facilities were operational throughout the quarter this includes all ames closetmaid clopay and cornellcookson facilities each of these businesses provide critical products supporting national infrastructure to the extent practical we continue to permit our employees in these segments to work remotely and as ive mentioned before all of our manufacturing and distribution facilities have implemented strict protocols to ensure employee health and safety while at the workplacein late march our ames uk facilities were closed by government directive and our employees were directed to stay at home by early june we were able to reopen our facility there which was ahead of our anticipated july resumption of operations in mexico our closetmaid manufacturing facility that supports the us and canada sales closed for approximately 15 weeks in april but has been operational sinceturning to our defense electronics business telephonics continues to operate at all of its sites as it provides critical manufacturing and services supporting the us military and its operations are essential for maintaining our national securitylets talk about the quarter and performance in consumer and professional products we saw a strong third quarter demand for seasonal lawn and garden tools storage and organizational solutions at major retailers and home centers across north america and in australia upon reopening in june there was strong uk demand for our product offerings as well our ames strategic initiative remains on track and includes implementing an integrated business intelligence system supporting all of our ames operations rationalizing our distribution and manufacturing facilities and investing in automation and ecommerce capabilitiesour home and building products segment revenue declined slightly compared to the prior year quarter strong residential sectional garage door sales later in the quarter almost completely offset the reduction in sales seen in the first part of the quarter sales in our commercial door business increased slightly in the quarter compared to the prior yearoperations at telephonics have continued uninterrupted and q3 revenue exceeded the prior year the anticipated second tranche of bookings related to the lockheed martin mh60 romeo foreign military sale program with india was funded and 49 million was booked to backlog in the quarter telephonics experienced some slowing from suppliers during q3 which could slow certain customer deliveries and work performed in q4we also are announcing today that were evaluating strategic alternatives for the system engineering group which we call seg which is a technical services subsidiary within our defense electronics segment providing advanced simulation and analysis for the us navy and us missile defense agency telephonics core business focus is on defense electronic systems products and systems we believe that seg would benefit from being part of a parent organization that is more focused on government technical servicesadditionally were cognizant of the governments organizational conflict of interest called oci standards and believe that such a sale better aligns our businesses with those standardsseg is wellrun with a strong management team and annual revenues of approximately 30 million the timing of this process is bolstered by segs recent 119 million award from the naval surface warfare center dahlgren divisionthis is an opportunity for us to provide incremental value to griffon shareholders while also positioning seg for enhanced growth with a suitable acquirer weve already started the process to sell this business and were working to get that done in the near futurelets turn to our balance sheet during the quarter we continued to work on strengthening our balance sheet and positioning the company for future growth in june we issued an additional 150 million of senior notes as a tackon to the 575% notes we issued in february 2020 weve now fully refinanced our 1 billion of 525% notes due in 2022 with 575% notes that have maturity in 2028 as a reminder in january we also extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility to 2025 and expanded its borrowing capacity by 50 million to 400 million with an additional 100 million of availability through an accordion featureweve established a solid foundation for growing the company and we have ample liquidity to weather any nearterm effects of the pandemic and other market uncertainty while continuing to invest in all of our businessesfinally earlier today our board authorized a 0075 per share dividend payable on september 17 2020 to shareholders of record on august 20 2020 this marks the 36th consecutive quarterly dividend to shareholders which has grown at an annualized compound rate of 17% since we initiated it in 2012let me turn it over to brian for a little closer look at some of the numbers brianbrian g harris\\xa0\\xa0senior vice president and chief financial officerthank you ron ill start by highlighting our third quarter consolidated performance revenue increased 10% to 632 million and adjusted ebitda increased 31% to 69 million both in comparison to the prior year quarter normalized gross profit for the quarter was 165 million increasing 68% over the prioryear quarter while gross margin contracted 80 basis points to 261%third quarter selling general and administrative expenses were 114 million including 16 million of charges related to the ames strategic initiative as a percentage of sale sga adjusted for the charges decreased 280 basis points to 177%third quarter gaap income from continuing operations was 22 million or 050 per share compared to the prioryear period of 14 million or 033 per share excluding items that affect comparability from both periods current quarter adjusted net income was 26 million or 059 a share compared to the prior year of 13 million or 031 per sharethe effective tax rate excluding items that affect comparability for the quarter was 308% and yeartodate was 326% capital spending was 12 million in the third quarter in line with prior year depreciation and amortization totaled 16 million for the third quarterregarding our segments consumer and professional products third quarter revenue increased 20% to 329 million over the prior year quarter driven by increased volume of 19% propelled by customer demand for home improvement in north america and australia favorable price and mix of 1% and incremental revenue from the apta acquisition was 2% all partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 2% organic growth was 18%adjusted ebitda was 37 million increasing 55% from the prior year quarter due to the increased revenue as mentioned a moment ago partially offset by increased tariffs and covid19 related costs adjusted ebitda margin was 113% compared to 88% in the prior year quarter the ames strategic initiative continues on plan and we expect to close our belle vernon pennsylvania and falls city nebraska facilities by the end of the fiscal yearhome and building products third quarter revenue decreased 1% to 219 million over the prior year quarter due primarily to decreased volume of residential sectional garage door orders in april which were down 18% but then had subsequent recovery in may and june adjusted ebitda increased 16% to 39 million over the prior year quarter due to the benefits of general operating efficiency improvements partially offset by the decrease in revenue and covid19 related inefficiencies and direct costs adjusted ebitda margin was 179% in the quarter compared to 153% in the prior year quarterdefense electronics third quarter revenue increased 5% to 84 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to increased deliveries and volume of radar and communication systems adjusted ebitda during the period was 4 million compared to the prior year quarter of 7 million impacted by mix and program inefficiencies on radar and communication systems as well as increased bid and proposal costs yeartodate backlog as of june 30 2020 was 350 million a 19 million increase from q2 and we expect to continue to build backlog in the fourth quarter corporate and unallocated expenses excluding depreciation were 11 million in the third quarterregarding our balance sheet as of june 30 2020 we had 72 million in cash and total debt outstanding of 113 billion resulting in a net debt position of 106 billion and debttoebitda leverage of 44 times as calculated based on our debt covenants this reflects one full turn of deleveraging from the prior year period borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility was 274 million subject to certain loan covenantsmoving to our fourth quarter and fullyear outlook like many other companies last quarter we withdrew our guidance because of the uncertainties arising out of the covid19 pandemic we now have a clear picture of the effects of the pandemics impact for this year as a result we are reinstating guidance for fiscal 2020 we normally give guidance once a year and do not update that guidance during the year and we plan to return to that policy however given the continued uncertainty resulting resulting from covid19 we felt it was appropriate for us to provide an update as an exception in this instancewe are now providing guidance for the full year 2020 of approximately 23 billion in revenue and 270 million plus of adjusted ebitda before unallocated expenses note that our overall guidance even with the conservative q4 outlook is higher than our original guidance for the year of 250 million plus of adjusted ebitda before unallocated expenses that we provided back in november further our full year fiscal 2020 guidance includes approximately 60 million for capital expenditures 64 million for depreciation and amortization 65 million for net interest expense and 45 million for unallocated expenses with all of these remaining the same as originally communicated during our november 2019 earnings callnow ill turn the call back over to ronronald j kramer\\xa0\\xa0chairman of the board and chief executive officerthanks brian griffons yeartodate performance is something we are all collectively very proud of considering how much weve achieved in just a few short years since we began this portfolio repositioning its especially gratifying at the time we announced it we discussed the opportunities for topline growth and margin expansion through the realization of efficiencies during the integration process of all of our acquired companies further we expect it to become stronger competitively by providing increased value to our customers in terms of our broader product offering improved service levels and enhanced efficiency we continue to believe the diversity of our businesses our emphasis on domestic manufacturing and our focus on the leading brands provides a strong foundation for future growth this quarter in particular brings into focus what our repositioned portfolio can accomplish and the potential upside of following our strategygriffons performance has been excellent and we believe there is still considerable opportunity for improving the performance of our businesses in addition we remain committed to finding strategic acquisitions that expand and strengthen our product portfolio within our home markets were getting closer to our objective of 35 times net debt to ebitda leverage our free cash flow has and will continue to improve and we expect to see our leverage to continue to decline further as we execute our business planin closing id like to thank our workforce which has shown exceptional dedication and perseverance throughout this challenging period we appreciate the importance of their work in order to deliver these excellent resultsoperator well take any questionsquestions and answersoperatorcertainly  our first question comes from bob labick of cjs securities please go aheadbob labick\\xa0\\xa0cjs securities  analystgood afternoon and congratulations on some terrific resultsronald j kramer\\xa0\\xa0chairman of the board and chief executive officerthank you bobbrian g harris\\xa0\\xa0senior vice president and chief financial officerthanks bobbob labick\\xa0\\xa0cjs securities  analystyeah so i wanted to start obviously particularly in cpp just outstanding demand how do you  i guess how long do you think this can last and how do you position your products and brands to get more attention and to become repeat purchases and replacement purchases and what do you need to do with this increased focus on your products to fulfill the demand thats out thereronald j kramer\\xa0\\xa0chairman of the board and chief executive officerwell ill start by reminding you that we were having a very good year going into covid and the strength of our brands the demand for our product was already ahead of expectations and certainly ahead of last year going into this pandemic the structural changes that we clearly are seeing of how people are purchasing the types of products that we provide is  had been moving to a way far more deliberate ecommercesupported model and that includes web searching as well as brick and mortar retail and online purchasing and our strategy has been for some time that were going to be the leading brands and the best products in every product that we sell that was the story around ames that was the story around us buying closetmaid and then fitting it into ames so the strategy was clearly working what happened with the stayathome is things are accelerating and there is clearly an economy thats functioning quite well even during this incredibly difficult timeits not lost on us that were at record unemployment its not lost on us that were in a recession and yet our business trends are not only surviving theyre prospering so that result of being at home we view as it was working going into this accelerating during it and are  the backend of your question is what weve been doing in terms of investing in the business the ames strategic initiative that we had announced in november was about the future for the company about being able to expand our distribution capability expand our product offerings we are believers in brands were builders of brands weve bought companies in every product category were at the early stages of what we view as the ames growth initiative and what you see in this quarter is clearly a very robust demand at the same time aside of operating efficiencies that were already in place driving increased performance so our plan going forward is to continue to do exactly what we have been doing in building the brands and supporting the best retailers both brick and mortar and online for every product that we sellbob labick\\xa0\\xa0cjs securities  analystokay thats great very helpful and then shifting over to telephonics the international is coming on and margins were a little late i guess in the quarter how do you see  is this year kind of the trough can we see some growth adjusting for the seg the potential strategic alternatives as you said and so how do you kind of look at the next 12 to 24 months on the telephonics sideronald j kramer\\xa0\\xa0chairman of the board and chief executive officeryeah weve talked about for some time that the telephonics business was bottoming we view that process as having played out as we expected covid clearly has had an impact on timing of orders but the demand for the core surveillance and reconnaissance products particularly radar systems we continue to see the backlog improving we expect that to showcase itself in the fourth quarter the sale of seg is the conclusion of whats been a very nice piece of telephonics and the story behind it is we bought it in 2005 weve built it up the sale of it is really about three things one it allows us to focus on the core of what telephonics does it should be a margin improvement story prospectively for us and it will be a small but meaningful additional part of our deleveraging story so its a gain its a business that we have built and the harvesting of it is part of our broader strategy of continuing to grow the core of telephonicsbob labick\\xa0\\xa0cjs securities  analystsuper congrats again on the quarterronald j kramer\\xa0\\xa0chairman of the board and chief executive officeri appreciate itoperatorour next question comes from julio romero of sidoti  company please go aheadjulio romero\\xa0\\xa0sidoti  company  analysthey good afternoonbrian g harris\\xa0\\xa0senior vice president and chief financial officerhi julioronald j kramer\\xa0\\xa0chairman of the board and chief executive officerhi juliojulio romero\\xa0\\xa0sidoti  company  analystso on cpp the strength youre seeing there can you give us a little more granularity on what products are leading that growth i know youve got a very diverse portfolio and you called out outdoor lawn and garden but youve also got some indoor lines like closetmaid that i assume would have also done well given everyones kind of cooped up indoors so i was hoping you could give us some specific examples of some product lines that are kind of leading that growthbrian g harris\\xa0\\xa0senior vice president and chief financial officersure so you sort of hit it we have seen growth in demand of  in both lawn and garden and the home organization side home organization is a  pretty much a doityourself type item where people can buy the products either at a store or online and install it home and garden of course is something thats done mostly outside and we are seeing people using their time at home and the fact that theyre not spending on other things such as travel or going to restaurants and investing in their homes and generally speaking our products are at price points that are affordable theyre not very large ticket items and thats whats been driving some of that demandjulio romero\\xa0\\xa0sidoti  company  analystgot it and could you talk about maybe the sequential trend in cpp maybe how that business performed in may and june and maybe give us a sense of how trends and fill rates are quartertodateronald j kramer\\xa0\\xa0chairman of the board and chief executive officerwe continue to seebrian g harris\\xa0\\xa0senior vice president and chief financial officersureronald j kramer\\xa0\\xa0chairman of the board and chief executive officerwe continue to see trends improving the stabilization had happened after the last time we spoke which was late april went into may accelerated into the end of the quarter and continues into july we expect this is going to continue the market share gains of the products that we provide the domestic manufacturingand distribution and weve been talking for several years that this focus of ours on being able to support the biggest providers of all the products its clear that the supply chains are moving to domestically sourced product we are the leading product leading market share in every major product category that we sell and were going to continue to invest in the brands to make sure that we get increased market share as we go forwardjulio romero\\xa0\\xa0sidoti  company  analystgot it and you saw a really nice rebound on the residential garage door side i remember last quarter you called out some customer hesitancy on the retail side individuals kind of didnt want to stand in line at major home centers do you think there has been more of a change in customer behavior since april or was it more like the dealer side that drove that growthbrian g harris\\xa0\\xa0senior vice president and chief financial officerso yes correct we saw a decline in april our orders in april were down 18% mostly being driven by home centers retail type sales with some decline in the dealers as we progressed into may sales started to normalize on all those channels and then come june and into july sales accelerated quite well and the commercial side saw good and normal volume and sales through the entire periodjulio romero\\xa0\\xa0sidoti  company  analystgot it so across the board kind of dealer and retail did well in junebrian g harris\\xa0\\xa0senior vice president and chief financial officeryes june and continued into julyronald j kramer\\xa0\\xa0chairman of the board and chief executive officerand we continue to see that trending up the other point that ill just make is the commercial side of the business is doing well we bought cornellcookson we had talked about the ability to provide the rolling steel doors as part of the warehouse business that was going to grow retail was going to continue to go through a transformation the security part of our business were the leading manufacturer of a series of security doors which is called the defender series continues to show growth the civil unrest thats going on around the country has actually spurred a level of demand in that business the clopay business was already the leading residential manufacturer owning cornellcookson gives us a leverage and were at the early days of the integration of that business obviously very gratifying to see the recovery from april residentially into may and its in our view a reflection of the stayathome trends that are gonejulio romero\\xa0\\xa0sidoti  company  analystgreat very nice job everyone ill hop back in the queueronald j kramer\\xa0\\xa0chairman of the board and chief executive officerwe appreciate it thanksbrian g harris\\xa0\\xa0senior vice president and chief financial officerthanks okoperator our next question comes from tim wojs of baird please go aheadtimothy wojs\\xa0\\xa0robert w baird  analysthey gentlemen good afternoon nice jobronald j kramer\\xa0\\xa0chairman of the board and chief executive officerthanks timbrian g harris\\xa0\\xa0senior vice president and chief financial officerthanks tim how are you doingtimothy wojs\\xa0\\xa0robert w baird  analystgood good thanks i guess my first question just curious on channel inventory particularly in cpp how would you characterize that relative to normal were hearing some of the categories are pretty tight just in terms of the level of demand kind of in may and june and into july so im just curious how youd characterize some of your partners channel inventories within your categoriesronald j kramer\\xa0\\xa0chairman of the board and chief executive officeri think thatbrian g harris\\xa0\\xa0senior vice president and chief financial officerso we have actually  i didnt mean to speak over you so we have actually seen good demand for our products as weve already discussed we have been able to service our customers very well our domestic manufacturing capability has really benefited us compared to others so when major home centers need products we are able to provide it to them or when any other home center or retail are needed so we have adequate inventory and adequate manufacturing capability to continue to provide those productsronald j kramer\\xa0\\xa0chairman of the board and chief executive officeri thinktimothy wojs\\xa0\\xa0robert w baird  analystokayronald j kramer\\xa0\\xa0chairman of the board and chief
